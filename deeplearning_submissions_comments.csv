The specific piece i find most problematic is your idea that AI is somehow limited by the humanity’s inability “to design an intelligence greater than itself”. First, there’s no reason why this isn’t true, and using the past as some sort of definite truth is ridiculous. For millions of years, apes couldn’t fly, yet two men managed to design a flying machine that worked over 100 years ago. Second, there’s a hidden statement in your paragraph stating that the intelligence is limited by the training set. Again, there’s no reason for this to be true. Models trained on 1200 elo chess have 1500+ elo end capacities. The whole point of using ML is that the algorithms are better pattern detectors than humans. Finally, the point on societal-level civilization i somewhat agree with, except that LLMs are already society-level intelligences, considering they’re trained on most of the internet."

5,lda0qd1,1e3qyxd,7,"I like this writing but disagree with the conclusion. A single human's intelligence isn't constant; it develops slowly through a process we call learning. The human brain is limited by the supply of resources, the need for rest, and overall lifespan. An artificial brain, on the other hand, can live much longer, be supplied with constant energy and cooling, and extend its capacity over time (in terms of compute power and memory). The main constraint of existing AI is the absence of a self-reinforcement loop. With LLMs, we are trying to solve this with tooling, but I believe we will have a technological breakthrough in this area soon.

The title is clickbait and doesn't align with the content. Yes, the environment and society can stifle intelligence for a while, but this is independent of intelligence growth, and usually, intelligence prevails in the end."

14,ld9w65d,1e3qyxd,-1,"Yes intelligence can't explode. A basic argument is that the amount of intelligence a AI has is defined by how it's programmed. It can't ""break out"" of it because that just needs something which is outside of its programming. It would have to have some mechanism which would allow it to add the mechanism.

Example: A LM alone can't upgrade and debug itself without humans. The required agency is outside of its programming.

Also software can't debug itself to a arbitrary depth in detail. Goedels theorem forbids that.

15,ldbm6iu,1e3qyxd,0,"As someone else stated earlier these are mostly philosophical but nonetheless intriguing so thank you for sharing.

Critiques as follows:

> the environment bounds intelligence 

Your argument here seems predicated on two events:
1) some high intelligence individuals don't realize their true potential bc of environmental factors.
2) others are born too early to have the resources to capitalize on their potential

Both of those are 'wrong place wrong time's arguments.
Counterpoints: already we see that a material share of energy, mind share, and matter are being directed to scaling machine intelligence so I don't think (1) holds. (2) Ignores the great scientific potential we already have today, and also ignores that we continue to advance our potential and machine intelligence is almost certain to help here too


> Intelligence is cultural 

This one is harder to follow, specifically the summary doesnt really agree with the other preceding statements.

You're correct that *human* intelligence is cultural but we shouldn't anthropomorphize intelligence 



> Intelligence won't scale

This one seems to state that if super intelligence were possible then the billions of other humans minds would have already found it, this is simply not true.  Certainly humans have dreamt of non biological intelligence, but scientifically a lot needed to come together for the potential to exist as it does today  

Chinchilla scaling laws would be a good counter point here, we are no where close to exhausting out of distribution tokens on the open Internet"
16,ldc9gp9,1e3qyxd,0,"I like the sentiment.

I feel if there was a TLDR version it would be easier to identify the hard arguments.

Can you frame the hard argument in three sentences? I didn't spot it while scrolling, sry."
17,ldatv5q,1e3qyxd,-1,"The arguments you are making are very human centered. There's no reason to expect that AGI/ASI must follow the same limits or mechanisms as biological systems.   
  
The only environmental impact is that of the data and how it is presented and scored. There's no evolutionary pressure, because these systems do not have to worry about natural selection (that's probably a good thing - if they somehow start caring about being ""shut off"" then we're in trouble). 

And it's completely false that individual intelligence won't scale. It's not about size, but emergent behavior. Think about Conway's Game of Life: Individual cells have a small amount of ""intelligence"" in their state transitions, but when you combine them, you can produce clusters with incredibly complex behavior (even Turing complete computers). In that analogy, the network neuron (VVDot -> Act) would be the GoL cell.   
As it is now, we could claim that GPT4 is smarter than every OpenAI employee, because of the sheer breadth of knowledge it possesses. You would have to move the goalpost to specific sub-fields which it was not explicitly trained for to make an argument otherwise. 

That said, you had brought up the point of computational irreducibility, which I think is valid so far as how we currently use LLMs. At the moment, a LLM computes in inconstant time: input -> forward-> output. Which means that the set of all problems they can compute must also be computable in constant time (or bounded non-constant time such that they can be computed within the model's depth).  
When you string together multiple forward passes (e.g. Agentic LLMs), you break that requirement so long as the NC problem can be broken down into simpler steps which are computable by the LLM (in TC). There may be problems that cannot be broken down like that, but then humans can't compute them either (out brains also must compute more complex problems in smaller TC steps). 

There is, however, one big difference between a biological system and (agentic) LLMs, which is continual learning. Currently there is no way for LLMs to efficiently learn new implicit knowledge, only access explicit knowledge through the input context. Whether this can be solved through external augmentation or through a yet unknown internal weight update mechanism is yet to be determined."
18,ld9vrf4,1e3qyxd,-3,"You are right in the sense that scale in terms of parameters won't help AI reach AGI.


But it should be obvious that scaling up in data, tasks and training paradigms has helped inch closer to that in a very obvious manner, and that there is nothing to suggest any inflection point there.


Instead, every day we gain new insights about how insanely bad our data is and how incredible it is that these algorithmic behemoths manage to learn so much from it in the first place."

3) Average human can remember \~7 things at once. Working memory of LLM is huge, not just huge, but very very ... very huge. They can solve many problems at once, which would take an ordinary person a lot of time to just build logical chains.

For example, base train on English texts, but fine tune for therapy / psych (if such a data set exists).  Ignore the industry benchmarks and have it evaluated by real people using likert scale questions on how helpful they feel it was. Collaborate with academia and have it a/b tested against chat based therapy sessions with a real person. Then capture the logs of it all and use it to fine tune it more (anonymized of course).

The problem is that the number of iterations (back propagations) in an epoch changes depending on dataset size and batch size. 

For example, if you train a model with batch size 100, and the dataset is 100 samples, then 10 epochs is only 10 iterations. If you train ImageNet with 1.3 million samples, 10 epochs is 130k iterations. In the first case, basically nothing will be learned because it hasn't had time to.

The alternative is just use iterations (which I would argue is more fair and makes more sense anyway). Back in the day, before keras and pytorch, we used iterations. Even to this day, I still use iterations (I calculate the number of epochs to train based on epoch=iteration*batch/dataset)."

Anyway, when we refer to the “black box” nature of DNNs we don’t mean “we don’t know what’s going on”, but rather “we know exactly what’s going on in theory, but there are so many simple calculations that it’s impossible for a human being to keep track of them”. Just think of a simple ConvNet for MNIST classification like AlexNet: it has ~62M parameters, meaning that all the simple calculations (gradients update and whatnot) are performed A LOT of times in a single backward pass.

Also, DNNs often work with a latent representation, which adds another layer of abstraction for the user: the “reasoning” part happens in a latent space that we don’t know anything about, except some of its properties (and again, if we make the calculations we actually **do know** exactly what it is, it’s just unfeasible to do them).

To address these points, several research projects have focused on network interpretability, that is, finding ways of making sense of NNs’ reasoning process. [Here’s a review](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2012.14261.pdf) written in 2021 regarding this."

The function space isn't continuous but rather discrete, discretized by the dataset points. Hence, increasing the size of dataset can help in increasing overall accuracy. This is relatable with Nyquist criterion. Less data and its more likely our approximation is wrong. Given the dimensions of input space and range of each input variable, the dataset size is nothing. E.g. for 224x224 rgb input image, input space has total pow(256, 224x224x3) possible input values, which is unimaginably large number, mapping each to a correct class label (total 1000 classes) is very difficult for any approximator.

188,l06ea24,1c770nz,14,"Echoing everybody else's advice, take a break. However, I want to give a slightly different reason: You will always feel like you are a little bit behind, and that is okay. In fact, the sooner you teach yourself that feeling a little bit behind all the new stuff coming out is acceptable, and that taking breaks is not only acceptable but also normal and good for you, the more successful you will be at keeping up. Let me explain.

I have been in a PhD focused on AI for 8 years. I am about to finish that PhD. Before that I worked in robotics for 3 years. Before that I did a masters program in robotics. I can tell you that at no point in my journey have I ever felt ""caught up."" For many years this was alarming and constantly unsettling. Like you have described, I felt a pressure that if I wasn't constantly keeping up with new techniques, models, and achievements I would fall so far behind I would never catch up again. What I've learned in the last few years is that you never get fully caught up, but that's okay because no one else does either. Having conversations at conferences like NeurIPS, RSS, ICRA, AAMAS etc, You start to realize that even people responsible for the most impressive achievements in one area have no idea what's going on in other areas. I remember in one conversation at one of these conferences last year, I got to explain to a multi agent learning best paper first author all that was going on with NeRFs, diffusion, Gaussian splatting, and its implications for robot mapping and coordination. It was a illustrative experience of how someone awarded for moving deep learning forward was still ""behind"" on what is changing in deep learning.

Even the best of us don't know everything. The most valuable thing you can do is be proud of what you know at this moment, assure yourself that as long as you keep trying you will keep learning and improving in the future, and that taking breaks for mental health is a critical step in constant learning and improvement. ![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|grin)"

That way you not only are learning but it's fun and you can find clever ways to use what you know on stuff you already know. 

Also, dumb ways to use the knowledge work almost as well as the clever ways. You can save a little mental energy by not requiring cleverness, when cleverness just won't do.  

Just require yourself to at least vaguely think about  how you can use the new knowledge of programming, theory, or task-adjacent knowledge to be useful by solving any problems you have or might have later.

""I think the complexity of Python package management holds down AI application development more than is widely appreciated. AI faces multiple bottlenecks — we need more GPUs, better algorithms, cleaner data in large quantities. But when I look at the day-to-day work of application builders, there’s one additional bottleneck that I think is underappreciated: The time spent wrestling with version management is an inefficiency I hope we can reduce. ""

Another bottleneck is hardware integration, because the code must be compact and efficient to reduce energy consumption yet must operate in real time, and requires extensive testing before real-world deployment. MATLAB have solid track record in the industry for that. 

Rather than MATLAB vs. Python, the better question is how we can use them together. MathWorks is building the bridge between the two worlds.

222,fzrw77i,i0m1e6,2,">\- In its current state, DL lacks causality, commonsense, intuitive physics, goal/intent understanding

What makes you think that's necessary?

>\- Roads and infrastructure need to undergo changes before SDCs can be deployed with reliability

Why? Humans can do it without any changes, so we can say for sure the task is solvable without any hardware exterior to the car.

>\- Legal hurdles need to be overcome

That's not a technical issue.

>\- Human drivers make mistakes too, but our mistakes are much more predictable than SDCs (e.g., human drivers don't drive into parked firetrucks and overturned cars)

Are they? The mistakes may be different, and of course as humans, we tend to forgive human mistakes easier. That doesn't mean AI mistakes will be more frequent or worse.

&#x200B;

>This suggests further training its deep learning algorithms with the data it is collecting from hundreds of thousands of cars will be enough to bridge the gap to L5 SDCs by the end of 2020.

Did he really say that? I don't think he claimed it's just more training. Nothing stops Tesla to deploy any software they want, nothing limits the hardware to deep learning only."

240,joakv9t,14aevdi,3,"Are you new to DL and deciding if you want to do it more seriously? If so I would 100% do colab. The GPUs it provides are pretty damn nice when you pay for pro, and it’s very reasonable for learning. Bias plug I wrote a [book](https://www.amazon.com/Inside-Deep-Learning-Algorithms-Models/dp/1617298638/ref=nodl_?dplnkId=80dd168e-005b-4d95-bfef-5b2d5be46ee9) teaching DL using only colab for compute, and tricks from fast.ai can extend the utility of just a colab session even farther. Once you feel like you really need to train longer, then it would make more sense to upgrade to a dedicated GPU that you own. It would also give you time to save up for one with more memory, as model size has been consistently increasing and make your life a lot easier."

242,jobtpgn,14aevdi,2,"I’ve worked in this exact situation for a while (laptop with 16GB 3080), in my view it’s:

- great for deep code, if you write libraries, have to debug,.. colab is just shite for this

- great for proof of concepts or small trainings (PEFL, fine tuning)

- a no go if you want to train at scale, but the same goes for colab, in that case you prep a job on your machine then send to the cloud

Colab would be best for a lot of experiments where you use existing code/checkpoints, you can’t beat the fire and forget aspect here.

I’ve a ASUS Strix, works ok under Linux, no cooling issues whatsoever. If you go this route I would recommend a AMD CPU for cooling reasons, the GPU will produce enough heat by itself."
